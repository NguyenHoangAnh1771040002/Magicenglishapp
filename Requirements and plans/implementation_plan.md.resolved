# Implementation Plan - Magic English 2.0

We are upgrading Magic English to Version 2.0 based on the updated SRS. This plan focuses on adding high-value learning tools: Audio Pronunciation, Smart Review (Flashcards), and Data Management.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Audio TTS**: We will use the browser's built-in `window.speechSynthesis` API for offline, free text-to-speech. This does not require an external API key.
> **Flashcards**: A new "Smart Review" tab will be added to the Navigation.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Magic Vocab Enhancements (Audio & Export)
#### [MODIFY] [MagicVocab.vue](file:///c:/Coding/FullStack/BTL/Magicenglishapp/src/app/components/MagicVocab.vue)
- Add **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: A "Speaker" icon on each vocabulary card to read the word and example sentence.
- Add **Export Button**: A button in the header to download the vocabulary list as a JSON file (Backup).

### 2. Smart Review Module (Flashcards)
#### [NEW] [SmartReview.vue](file:///c:/Coding/FullStack/BTL/Magicenglishapp/src/app/components/SmartReview.vue)
- Create a new component for Flashcards.
- Logic: Fetch words from `localStorage`, shuffle, and display in a "Question/Answer" flip card format.
- UI: "Front" shows the word. "Back" shows meaning, IPA, and example.
- Controls: "Easy", "Hard" buttons (mocking Spaced Repetition logic).

#### [MODIFY] [Navigation.vue](file:///c:/Coding/FullStack/BTL/Magicenglishapp/src/app/components/Navigation.vue)
- Add a new tab `Smart Review` (Icon: `Brain` or `School`).

#### [MODIFY] [App.vue](file:///c:/Coding/FullStack/BTL/Magicenglishapp/src/app/App.vue)
- Register the new `SmartReview` component and handle tab switching.

### 3. Grammar Checker Enhancements
#### [MODIFY] [GrammarChecker.vue](file:///c:/Coding/FullStack/BTL/Magicenglishapp/src/app/components/GrammarChecker.vue)
- Implement `History` feature: Save checked text and results to `localStorage`.
- Display a "Previous Checks" list for review.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Browser test to click the "Speaker" icon and verify no errors (sound verification is manual).
- Browser test to navigate to "Smart Review", flip a card, and verify content.
- Browser test to "Export" and see file download.

### Manual Verification
- User to verify Audio plays correctly on their device.
